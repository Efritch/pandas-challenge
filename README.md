# pandas-challenge
This repo holds all items related to the Python/Panadas homework assignment. My work is in a Jupyter Notebook.

My code 

Creates a District Summary that provides the following data;
1. Calculate the total number of schools
2. Calculate the total number of students
3. Calculate the total budget
4. Calculate the average math score 
5. Calculate the average reading score
6. Calculate the percentage of students with a passing math score (70 or greater)
7. Calculate the percentage of students with a passing reading score (70 or greater)
8. Calculate the percentage of students who passed math and reading (% Overall Passing)

All of these data points display in a dataframe.

My code continues on to find a summary of the math and reading score data for each school. In this school summary you will find the following data points;
1. School Name
2. School Type
3. Total number of studends per school
4. Total school budget
5. Per student budget amount
6. Average math score
7. Average reading score
8. The percentage of students passing math
9. The percentage of students passing reading
10. The percentage of students passing math and reading

Continuing on thru my code, you will find a data frame that lists the top five performing schools based on the percentage of students passing math and reading. There is another data frame that displays the bottom five performing schools also based on the percentage of students passing math and reading.
